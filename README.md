# Make More from Biagram to Transformer

## [Biagram](./01-Biagram.md)
We introduce bigram character level language model. We saw how we can train the model, how we can sample from the model, and how we can evaluate the quality of the model using the negative log likelihood loss.

## [MLP](./02-MLP.md)
Based on the single layer network built before, we step one more further to build an MLP which basically add hidden layers between input and output. We show that the performance is much better.
